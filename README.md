Database used: cassandra

â€¢ Cassandra is one of the popular column-family databases

`Created a Application of banking System `

There are some kind of safe for which Cassandra could be appropriate.

Those kinds of safe:

For transactional information, safety means a consistent view of the data regardless of access path. Eventual           consistency is no good when we're dealing with bank balances. Or the other hand, Cassandra would be fine for           logging the transaction details in an audit trail.
